## Professional Summary

I started my career off as a Business Analyst, primarily focused on writing and testing requirements around APIs for web services for my client. That experience sparked my curiosity about how different applications are able to communicate over the internet, which led me to get interested in the utility of the cloud and event-driven architecture.

I knew I wanted to work in cybersecurity but did not know which of the domains to focus on, so I took the Security+ and CISSP certifications to better understand what I wanted to focus on and I enjoyed the IAM and GRC domains the most, which are both important in the cloud.

I am currently in the MSCIA program, studying for the AWS SAA, doing labs and working on projects to augment my understanding of the cloud. I hope to gain a greater understanding of how the pieces of the puzzle come together within the cloud to help enable security throughout your organization.
